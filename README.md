# ADN, a content delivery service


Install with `make install`.

Currently only has an installer and an executable on linux, may work on macos though.

`adnw` has the default server of `web` and `adn` has a default server of `default`

config file is `~/.adn/config`

This progam can be used for local text storage in the same way you can use it for normal text storage.

executing "adn" without any arguments expects it to be in input mode - add a `-o` flag to put it to output mode.
